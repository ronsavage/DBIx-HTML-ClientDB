README file for DBIx::HTML::ClientDB.

Warning: WinZip 8.1 and 9.0 both contain an 'accidental' bug which stops
them recognizing POSIX-style directory structures in valid tar files.
You are better off using a reliable tool such as InfoZip:

1 Installing from a Unix-like distro
------------------------------------
shell>gunzip DBIx-HTML-ClientDB-1.04.tgz
shell>tar mxvf DBIx-HTML-ClientDB-1.04.tar

On Unix-like systems, assuming you have installed Module::Build V 0.25+:

shell>perl Build.PL
shell>./Build
shell>./Build test
shell>./Build install

On MS Windows-like systems, assuming you have installed Module::Build V 0.25+:

shell>perl Build.PL
shell>perl Build
shell>perl Build test
shell>perl Build install

Alternately, without Module::Build, you do this:

Note: 'make' on MS Windows-like systems may be called 'nmake' or 'dmake'.

shell>perl Makefile.PL
shell>make
shell>make test
shell>su              (for Unix-like systems)
shell>make install
shell>exit            (for Unix-like systems)

On all systems:

Run ClientDB.pm through you favourite pod2html translator.

If you are using my fancy-pom2.pl, with its 'default.css' file installed in
/apache2/htdocs/css/, you'd do:

shell>perl fancy-pom2.pl html -css ClientDB.pm > /apache2/htdocs/ClientDB.html

or perhaps something like:

shell>perl fancy-pom2.pl html -css ClientDB.pm > /perl/html/site/lib/DBIx/HTML/ClientDB.html

2 Installing from an ActiveState distro
---------------------------------------
shell>unzip DBIx-HTML-ClientDB-1.04.zip
shell>ppm install --location=. DBIx-HTML-ClientDB
shell>del DBIx-HTML-ClientDB-1.04.ppd
shell>del PPM-DBIx-HTML-ClientDB-1.04.tar.gz
